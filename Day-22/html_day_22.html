				This sentence has five words. <a href="">Here</a> are five more words. Five-word
				sentences are fine. <a href="">But</a> several together become monotonous. Listen to
				what is happening. The writing is getting boring.
			</p>
			<p>
				The <a href="">sound</a> of it drones. It’s like a stuck record. The ear demands
				some variety. Now listen. I vary the sentence length, and I create music. Music.
			</p>
			<p>
				The writing sings. It has a pleasant rhythm, a lilt, a harmony. I use short
				sentences. And <a href="">I</a> use sentences of medium length.
			</p>
			<p>
				And sometimes, when I am certain the reader is rested, I will engage him with a
				sentence of considerable length, a sentence that burns with
				<a href="">energy</a> and builds with all the impetus of a crescendo, the roll of
				the drums, the crash of the cymbals–sounds that say listen to this, it is important.
